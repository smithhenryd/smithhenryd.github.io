In my free time, I enjoy both learning new math and gaining a deeper understanding of math I had previously studied. Here is a running list of my favorite books:
- Kreyszig, E. (1991). [Introductory Functional Analysis with Applications](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Introductory+Functional+Analysis+with+Applications-p-9780471504597) (Vol. 17). John Wiley & Sons.
- Royden, H. L., & Fitzpatrick, P. (1968). [Real Analysis](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/real-analysis/P200000007113/9780137906529) (Vol. 2). New York: Macmillan.
- Shalev-Shwartz, S., & Ben-David, S. (2014). [Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/understanding-machine-learning/3059695661405D25673058E43C8BE2A6). Cambridge University Press.
