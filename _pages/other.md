As a graduate student, I hope to make academia more transparent and accessible, particularly for those students belonging to underrepresented backgrounds. For this reason, I have shared my [PhD application materials](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16bXPDfWCKHL-j7QOw1COtMJlBsH2XpoU?usp=sharing) in addition to my NSF GRFP [essays and reviews](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SPyIyD3dlvyqnO51aWIFOnQcD34TzaDt?usp=sharing). **Please do not copy any part of these statements; they are entirely my own.** I would be happy to respond to any questions about applying for graduate school/fellowships via email.
