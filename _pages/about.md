My name is Henry (he/him), and I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Stanford University](https://statistics.stanford.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Professors [Scott Linderman](https://web.stanford.edu/~swl1/) and [Brian Trippe](https://briantrippe.com/). My graduate studies are graciously supported by the [Knight-Hennessy fellowship](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/) and the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP).

<!-- Prior to beginning my PhD, I spent a year working as a research assistant for [Professor Amanda Prorok](https://proroklab.org/) at the University of Cambridge. In 2022, I graduated from Yale University with a B.S. in statistics and mathematics.  -->

I am broadly interested in applied probability and probabilistic machine learning (probabilistic ML), with applications to neuroscience and computational protein design. I am especially excited about continuous-time latent variable models.
