My name is Henry (he/him), and I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Stanford University](https://statistics.stanford.edu/), where I am also a Knight-Hennessy Scholar. Prior to beginning my PhD, I spent a year as a research assistant at the University of Cambridge Department of Computer Science. In 2022, I graduated from Yale University with a B.S. in statistics and mathematics. 

I am broadly interested in statistical machine learning and optimization. As a PhD student, I look forward to **expanding scientific understanding of modern machine learning algorithms so that they may be applied with greater confidence**. I am especially excited by the issues of interpretability and sample efficiency.
