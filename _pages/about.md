My name is Henry (he/him), and I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Stanford University](https://statistics.stanford.edu/), where I am also a Knight-Hennessy scholar. Prior to beginning my PhD, I spent a year as a research assistant at the University of Cambridge Department of Computer Science. In 2022, I graduated from Yale University with a B.S. in statistics and mathematics. 

I am interested in probabilistic machine learning (probabilistic ML) and, more generally, stochastic processes. As a PhD student, I hope to expand scientific understanding of modern machine learning algorithms so that they may be applied with greater confidence. I am especially excited by the issues of model interpretability and sample efficiency.
