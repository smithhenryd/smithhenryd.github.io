My name is Henry (he/him), and I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Stanford University](https://statistics.stanford.edu/). Prior to beginning my PhD, I spent a year as a research assistant at the University of Cambridge Department of Computer Science. In 2022, I graduated from Yale University with a B.S. in statistics and mathematics. 

Broadly, I am interested in statistical machine learning and optimization. As a PhD student, I look forward to researching the theoretical underpinnings of modern machine learning algorithms and how they can be made to be more sample-efficient. My research is graciously supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (GRF).
